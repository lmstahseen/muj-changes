/*
  # Fix Profile Creation During Signup

  1. New Functions
    - Improved `handle_new_user` function to properly create profiles for new users
    - Ensures proper data is copied from auth.users to public.profiles

  2. Security
    - Uses SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS during profile creation
    - Adds proper RLS policy to allow public signup

  3. Changes
    - Drops existing trigger if it exists
    - Creates new trigger on auth.users
    - Adds public policy for profile creation during signup
